Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial company that offers planned solutions and insurance to customers. What they wanted to address was the secure transfer of information of data between their servers and customers and bring it up to modern standards. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Implementing AES-256 was done well and brought the secure transfer of data up to modern industry standards. Coding securely is not only important, but vital to the integrity of user data, especially even more so when dealing with financial data. Data breaches and stolen credentials, especially in a financial company, could lead not only to the loss of customers’ monetary investment, but also could lead to the downfall of the company itself. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The part of the vulnerability assessment that was most challenging was the implementation of the dependency check tool for me, but also the most helpful once properly working.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Testing was done and it was found that most vulnerabilities were due to older libraries that were used in the previous code. In addition, not using HTTPS protocol and secure AES were rectified and brought to modern standards. Moving forward into the future, checking the security of the code with tools like dependency check will help ensure the data stays secure. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

After refactoring the code, I checked for bugs during runtime to make sure it was functional. After confirming that it ran as intended, I ran a dependency check to confirm that no new vulnerabilities were added. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used the schools’ resources as much as possible, checking discussion boards and announcement postings. Alongside this, I also found that checking Stack Overflow among other documentation websites helped with the issues that I ran into.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

The ability to run dependency checks to check for software vulnerabilities, suppressing and identifying false ones, and the implementation of secure AES-256 encryption.
